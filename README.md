I love my dog Tamara.  She suffers from severe separation anxiety because of her past, however, I work with her everyday on being more confident in herself.  She has already made strides to accept new people into her life even though it takes her a lot of time to get used to new people.  She is also making strides in getting to know other dogs.  She has previously been exposed to cats, which she loves.  Now I work with her on being a dog when it comes to interacting with other dogs.  It is taking her time, but she will get there.
